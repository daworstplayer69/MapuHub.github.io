                        <p>Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, February 2) - The Department of Health (DOH) on Wednesday said 7,661 more COVID-19 infections were added to the countryâ€™s official case tally, which rose to 3,577,298.</p>
                        <p>Its data showed 76% of the newly confirmed cases occurred within the last two weeks, while the rest were late reports.</p>
                        <p>Among all regions, Western Visayas registered the highest increase in cases with 896, followed by Metro Manila with 873, and Calabarzon with 694.</p>
                        <p>Forty-three more fatalities were also recorded nationwide, including 26 from this month. The other 17 were from June to December 2021 and were encoded late.</p>
                        <p>They brought the COVID-19 death toll to 54,097.</p>

                        <p>The number of active cases is down to 160,297, which represents 4.5% of the total case count.</p>
                        <p>The daily positivity rate, or the percentage of infected people out of all tested, also declined to 24.8%. This is based on 40,453 tests reported on Jan. 31, according to the bulletin.</p>

                        <p> The DOH said it has yet to receive data from two testing laboratories which contributed an average of 0.9% of samples tested and 1.5% of positive results in the past 14 days.</p>
                        <p>It further noted that it deleted 28 duplicate entries from its data after final validation and corrected as deaths 28 cases it earlier tagged as recoveries.
                        According to DOH, the country is now classified as "moderate risk" for COVID-19 after recording negative infection growth rates in recent days. </p>
