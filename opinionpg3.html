                          <p class="fs-5 mb-4 fw-lighter">Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, our lives have been greatly impacted in many aspects such as finance and especially in our mental health. Many of us are confronted with difficulties that may be stressful, upsetting, and elicit powerful emotions in both adults and children. </p>

                          <p class="fs-5 mb-4 fw-lighter">During the COVID-19 pandemic, it's common to experience tension, anxiety, sadness, and concern; however, you, the people you care about, and those around you will become more resilient if you learn to manage with stress in a healthy way. </p>

                          <p class="fs-5 mb-4 fw-lighter">Pressure and the feeling of being overworked ut at the same time not learning as much compared to face-to-face classes. This online learning setup has up and down effects in a student's mental health. Some students continued their education with this setup, on the other hand, some students stopped for a while for several reasons such as helping their family to sustain themselves by working; and the incompatibility to learn in the online classes.</p>

                          <p class="fs-5 mb-4 fw-lighter">With these cases, it is safe to say that COVID-19 robbed two years of our life, staying at home, and socializing through the internet. Moreover, we all have our own ways to cope up with the stress this pandemic brought to us. </p>

                          <p class="fs-5 mb-4 fw-lighter">The effect of COVID-19's cases increase also takes place to the number of people who are diagnosed with mental health disorder such as depression. Even though we practice physical social distancing, we must not apply it to our friends and families as we all need someone to rely on to keep our sanity. As vaccines and boosters are now already available in the country, it is possible to bring our normal life back sooner or later. </p>
