                          <p class="fs-5 mb-4 fw-lighter">Due to the rising cases of Omicron which is a new variant of the COVID-19, Mapua University decided to take a health break both for students and the faculties. According to the transparency report made by the student council, an estimated total of 750 students are positive with COVID-19 which is pretty high as this new variant just spreaded around the corner. However, Mapuans are somehow not satisfied with this move made by the university.</p>

                          <p class="fs-5 mb-4 fw-lighter">On the memo Mapua University posted last January 13, all classes will be delivered in asynchronous mode until the end of the term in which students will be facing their modules on the second half of this term. Moreover, all deadlines from each subject are to be submitted from 10th week for students with no issues and 11th week for students diagnosed with the virus. On contrary, as these protocols are being implemented, students are not satisified with this decision. </p>

                          <p class="fs-5 mb-4 fw-lighter">Because of a two week health break the university gave, students are having a hard time learning the topics from the subjects they took, as watching video lectures are not enough for them to learn. With this case, students marked this decision as a 'wrong move' from the university as it decreased their willingness to learn.</p>

                          <p class="fs-5 mb-4 fw-lighter">Though it has been roughly 2 years of pure online classes, seeing that be altered in such a way that removes more interaction from not only the teachers but to other students as well which is likely the only social interaction some students even have for the remaining duration of the semester could pose more problems than solve it, which it was its main purpose to begin with, and it could affect their performance in doing their school works negatively.</p>

                          <p class="fs-5 mb-4 fw-lighter">Write your thoughts below, fellow Mapuans! We'd love to hear more from your side!</p>

                                        When I look at the universe and all the ways the universe wants to kill us, I find it hard to reconcile that with statements of beneficence.
