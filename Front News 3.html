                        <p>MANILA â€” Mapua University and Malayan Colleges Laguna (MCL) launched Wednesday a "digital-first" college, offering a flexible learning experience to students in the fields of business and technology.</p>
                        <p>The Mapua Malayan Digital College (MMDC), which operates under MCL, will start holding classes for School Year 2022-2023 in August.</p>
                        <p>For its first year, the MMDC will offer degree programs in information technology and business administration, its chief learning officer Derrick Latreille said at the college's virtual launch event.</p>
                        <p>Online synchronous classes are required only once a week for an hour and a half, Latreille said, adding that the setup minimizes the chances of students encountering internet issues since learning would take place mostly through asynchronous sessions.</p>

                        <span class="caption text-muted">Synchronous Classes</span>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">"We don't have the typical lectures and typical tests. Instead, every class is structured around projects, problems and cases, which means we don't give you a test at the end," <b>Latreille said.</b></blockquote>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">"We evaluate what you produce, the outputs you produce during and at the end of your 12-week course," <b>he explained.</b></blockquote>
                        <p>The college can rent out gadgets to students "for a small fee" that will be paid each term. It will also provide students with pocket WiFis, which is covered in the tuition.</p>
                        <p>Latreille said one school year in MMDC "could cost as little as less than P60,000 per year and [students] can set up payment terms."</p>
                        <p>The MMDC will also establish learning hubs in select Ayala Malls, where students can access learning resources and meet their peers in-person to work on projects.</p>
                        <p>The college will follow MCL's trimester scheme and give graduates MCL diplomas, school officials said.</p>
                        <p>Students in their final term will also receive intensive job application training.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">"We're really coaching you heavily in that last term to get [you] ready to engage [in] the workforce," <b>said Latreille.</b></blockquote>
                        <p>Latreille said the MMDC is expecting around "a few hundred" students for its pioneer batch but noted that the learning hubs are capable of handling "over a thousand" learners.</p>
