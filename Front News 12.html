                        <p>The Commission on Higher Education (CHEd) and Mapua University revealed on Tuesday that they are starting to equip the country's 45 Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) with data science and analytics skills for the post-Covid-19 pandemic world, following the launching of the Data Analytics and Digital Transformation Training for Higher Education, an executive program delivered by Carnegie Mellon University-Australia (CMUA), a global leader in data analytics.</p>
                        <p>The program is a 10-day virtual training that combines a comprehensive business intelligence, data analytics and technology management curriculum with a hands-on focus.</p>
                        <p>The 60 participants, who come from 45 HEIs all around the Philippines, are taught by CMUA’s expert pool of faculty who are also industry experts, with many active industry collaborations that put them at the forefront of data science developments.</p>

                        <span class="caption text-muted">Data Science</span>
                        <p>The participating HEIs are Agusan Del Sur State College of Agriculture and Technology, Aklan State University, Angeles University Foundation, Apayao State College, Ateneo De Davao University, Benguet State University, Biliran Province State University, Cebu Technological University-Main Campus, Davao Del Sur State College, De La Salle Medical and Health Institute, De La Salle Medical and Health Sciences Institute, Divine Word College of Bangued, Don Mariano Marcos Memorial State University, Don Mariano Marcos Memorial State University (Mid-La Union Campus), Ifugao State University, Iloilo State University, Iloilo State College of Fisheries, Kalinga State University, Leyte Normal University, Manuel S. Enverga University Foundation, Mapua University, Mariano Marcos State University, Marikina Polytechnic College, Monkayo College of Arts, Sciences and Technology, Mountain Province State Polytechnic College, New Era University, Northern Iloilo Polytechnic State College and Batad Campus, Polytechnic University of the Philippines, President Ramon Magsaysay State University, Quezon City University, Saint Francis of Assisi College, St. Anthony's College, St. Paul University Philippines, Systems Technology Institute (STI), STI College Surigao, Tarlac State University, University of Mindanao, University of Nueva Caceres-Bataan, University of Perpetual Help Sytem DALTA Molino, University of Southeastern Philippines, University of Southern Philippines Mintal Campus, University of the Cordilleras, University of the Philippines, Wesleyan University-Philippines.</p>
                        <p>The opening program was attended by CHEd Chairman J. Prospero De Vera 3rd, Mapua President Dr. Reynaldo Vea, Carnegie Mellon University-Australia Head Professor Emil Bolongaita and CHEd Offier-In-Charge Executive Director and International Affairs Staff Director Lily Freida Milla.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">“This partnership between Mapua and CMUA is very timely not only to improve efficiency in the operations of HEIs using data science but also build upon our efforts to create smart campuses and continue flexible learning in the post-Covid era,” <b>De Vera said.</b></blockquote>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">“CHEd pushed for the development of smart campuses across the country in Bayanihan 2, but we can only lay the foundations and we need technology experts to guide the HEIs to ensure efficiency of operations for enrollment, customizing delivery of education courses, faculty-student interaction, and recruitment of faculty,” <b>he added.</b></blockquote>
                        <p>Bolongaita said that this initiative will also empower Philippine educators and play a small part in helping the country recover from both the public health and economic crisis that Covid-19 has created.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">“The Philippines is being tested like never before and while it is difficult to imagine, the pandemic will come to pass. We want to make sure that educators are ready for this and that the workforce more broadly is upskilled,” <b>Bolongaita said.</b></blockquote>
                        <p>In the virtual training with CMUA, participants are also expected to develop asynchronous data analytics modules with localized applications that will cascade the training to other Philippine HEIs.</p>
                        <p>Participants may also choose to pursue a Master in Business Analytics at Mapua University, where the program is credited.</p>
                        <p>The said project is among the 11 programs that are lodged under CHEd’s International Continuing Professional (ICPE) grants which fund international certificate programs and short courses for HEI faculty and staff to develop and advance Philippine higher education.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">“In times of rapid change when there is uncertainty, we need to seize the opportunity to innovate and trailblaze on new grounds,” <b>De Vera said, adding that more HEIs may join the program as it accommodates maximum of 70 participants.</b></blockquote>
