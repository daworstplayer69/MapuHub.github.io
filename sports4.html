                        <p>Will these superstitions help catapult Mapua to great success in Season 96 of the NCAA?<br> Preparing for a game requires focus, keen awareness of the coach's strategies, and mental toughness.
</p>
                        <p>However, players (and even coaches) also believe in superstitions or routines which they think puts them in a better position to win games.</p>
                        <p>There are stories of tennis champion Serena Williams not changing her socks while a tournament is ongoing.</p>
                        <p>How about NBA legend Michael Jordan reportedly wearing his University of North Carolina shorts underneath his Chicago Bulls shorts?</p>

                        <!--Michael Jordan-->

                        <!--Brian Urlacher-->
                        <p>Meanwhile, football player Brian Urlacher made it a habit to snack on two chocolate chip cookies before a game to sweeten his luck.</p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src=https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/dam/imageserve/154668782/960x0.jpg?fit=bounds&format=jpg&width=960alt="..." />
                        <span class="caption text-muted">Brian Urlacher</span>

                        <p>The talented players of Mapua University are no different. This is also true for most of the student-athletes from various schools participating in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).</p>
                        <p>And with Season 96 looming on the horizon, we're curious to know how the Cardinals prepare superstitiously before and after a game. This also includes their must-have game essentials for added good luck.</p>

                        <p>Here are the game rituals and beliefs of some of Mapua's student-athletes:</p>

                        <!--Therese Angeli Manalo-->
                        <img class="img-fluid" src=https://aphrodite.gmanetwork.com/imagefiles/800/1613544930_385346790_35_ent.jpg alt="..." />
                        <span class="caption text-muted">Therese Angeli Manalo, Volleyball,<br>manalotherese_ (IG)</span>
                        <p>The 19-year-old middle blocker loves to eat a bar of chocolate before game time for added energy.“I also look for a quiet spot to meditate,” she added.“Meditating helps usher in positive thoughts and it calms me down before stepping on the court.”</p>

                      <!--SUNSHINE DALIDA-->
                          <img class="img-fluid" src=https://aphrodite.gmanetwork.com/imagefiles/800/1613544940_1077135857_35_ent.jpg alt="..." />
                          <span class="caption text-muted">Sunshine Dalida, Volleyball,<br>sunshinedalida02 (IG)</span>
                        <p>Wearing jersey number 23, this open spiker is a fan of Kapuso stars Sanya Lopez, Dingdong Dantes, and Marian Rivera. She cited Kapuso Mo, Jessica Soho, Bubble Gang, and Pepito Manaloto as her favorite GMA-7 shows.</p>

                        <p>But come game time, Sunshine turns off her fan mode and puts her game face on.“I always bring a rosary with me. It's part of my must-haves every game day,” she said. It's not surprising then that her pre- and post-game ritual is “praying” regardless if it's a win or a loss for her squad. </p>

                        <!--ANDREA SANTOS-->
                        <img class="img-fluid" src=https://aphrodite.gmanetwork.com/imagefiles/800/1613544955_18454967_35_ent.jpg alt="..." />
                        <span class="caption text-muted">Andrea Santos, Volleyball<br> Photo by: Andi Felix Santos (Facebook)</span>

                        <p>Psychology student Andrea Santos or Andi studied high school at Adamson University before transferring to Mapua for college.</p>

                        <p>This aspiring newscaster, who is a fan of Anne Curtis and Dingdong Dantes, doesn't have any special game day must-haves except for making sure that she brought with her the right set of uniform for the day.</p>

                        <p>Bubbly as always, Andi makes sure she attracts positive vibes before and after the game by having a good laugh with her teammates to calm her nerves.</p>

                        <!--ALLEN BACOLOR-->
                        <img class="img-fluid" src=https://aphrodite.gmanetwork.com/imagefiles/800/1613544980_1429318916_35_ent.jpg alt="..." />
                        <span class="caption text-muted">Allen Clark Bacolor, volleyball<br> Photo by: allen_bacolor_01 (IG)</span>

                        <p>The hard-hitting Allen knows what it takes to win. A champion player in high school, Allen is now helping Mapua to reach its goal of winning the championship.</p>

                        <p>“The best thing about this sport is you can express your feelings when playing it,” he said about volleyball.</p>

                        <p>Listening to worship songs before a game soothes Allen's nerves.<br>He has another ritual while in the middle of a game.<br>“I love touching the floor of the playing court just to feel it and then say a prayer,” he shared.</p>

                        <!--KARL LASTIMOSA-->
                        <img class="img-fluid" src=https://aphrodite.gmanetwork.com/imagefiles/800/1613545015_263611587_35_ent.jpg alt="..." />
                        <span class="caption text-muted">Karl Christian Lastimosa, volleyball<br> Photo by: karl_chrstn (IG)</span>

                        <p>Utility spiker Karl Christian Lastimosa was a force to be reckoned with during his stint with the San Sebastian College Recoletos.<br>Today, the 19-year-old student-athlete brings that A-game of his to help lift Mapua against tough competition from other NCAA schools.</p>

                        <p>If you're a fan and dreaming of having a photo with KC, better make sure you don't do it hours before a game.<br>“We avoid taking pictures before a game starts because of the superstition that we will lose if we do it,” KC said.</p>

                        <p>To be clear though, KC will still oblige to photo requests from fans before game time because he's a nice guy.<br>So yes, that no-picture code is not etched in stone and you can still approach him.</p>

                        <p>Here's a tip though: the team loves to eat out after a victory so perhaps that is the best time to approach him for some snaps. You can also guarantee that he'll be in a great mood.</p>

                        <!--Jeremy Santos-->

                        <span class="caption text-muted">Jeremy Garcia Santos, volleyball<br> Photo by: jeremy.g.santos (IG)</span>

                        <p>The 22-year-old libero grew up in a sports-oriented but competitive environment. He loves to watch films made by Studio Ghibli and is a self-confessed fan of former Kapuso star Angel Locsin.</p>

                        <p>“Unlike most athletes, I try to be as calm as possible before a game,” he said about his pre-game ritual.<br>“I like to be left alone as it helps keep me calm. If I get excited, I become fidgety and my nerves start going all over the place,” Jem said.</p>

                        <p>He added, “I don't cut my nails the night before a game. I also don't cut my hair or shave my facial hair.”</p>

                        <!--Adrrian Nocum-->

                        <span class="caption text-muted">Adrian Clarence Nocum, Basketball<br> Photo by: adrianclarence10 (IG)</span>

                        <p>The 21-year-old shooting guard is a huge fan of action superstar Robin Padilla.<br>He likes band music, OPM to be exact, and mentioned the songs "Halaga" by Parokya ni Edgar, "Ligaya" by the Eraserheads, and "Kundiman" by Silent Sanctuary as his favorites.</p>

                        <p>On the court, Rence just prays before and after a game and his must-have items are just the basics.<br>“Just make sure I have my jersey, my socks, and basketball shoes,” he said coolly.</p>

                        <p>“When we win, the first thing we do is thank God for the victory. When we lose, we double our efforts in training and correct the mistakes from the previous game.”</p>

                        <!--Karl Mariano-->
                        <img class="img-fluid" src=https://aphrodite.gmanetwork.com/imagefiles/800/1613545159_948180959_35_ent.jpg alt="..." />
                        <span class="caption text-muted">Karl Adrian Mariano, Basketball<br> Photo by: _karlsanity (IG)</span>

                        <p>Winning a championship in the Juniors division gave Karl Adrian or Karlito a taste of how to win on the big stage.<br>He is, of course, hoping to replicate that experience with the Mapua Cardinals.</p>

                        <p>Karlito's must-haves during a game day are “air pods, a great meal, and ultimate focus.”<br>He continued, “My pre-game rituals are listening to Drake songs and praying.</p>

                        <p>For my post-game rituals, I review the stat sheet to see what areas I need to improve on for the next game.”</p>

                        <!--Enrico Garcia-->
                        <img class="img-fluid" src=https://aphrodite.gmanetwork.com/imagefiles/800/1613545174_938158209_35_ent.jpg alt="..." />
                        <span class="caption text-muted">Enrico Joaquin Garcia, Basketball<br> Photo by: ejg_11 (IG)</span>

                        <p>“When we win, we do not celebrate like we're the champions. We celebrate then focus again for the next games,” said Enrico Joaquin or Joaquin.<br>“When we lose, we cheer each other up and learn from our mistakes and focus on correcting them.”</p>

                        <p>That mindset is what makes Joaquin an integral part for the Cardinals' upcoming Season 96 campaign.<br>He too has a few pre- and post-game rituals that he follows, which include “praying” and listening to “R&B music.”</p>

                        <p>His game-day items are not extraordinary as well but all essential to help him compete to the best of his abilities.<br>“The most important is the jersey and shoes,” he mentioned.<br>“I also bring a towel, water, ear pods for music, and extra clothes.”</p>

                        <p>Will these superstitions work and bring fortune to the Cardinals? Find out and cheer for the Mapua University in the Season 96 of the NCAA airing soon on GMA News TV and other Kapuso channels.</p>

                        <p>Viewers residing abroad can catch the games via GMA's flagship international channel, GMA Pinoy TV. For the program guide, visit <a href="https://www.gmanetwork.com/">www.gmapinoytv.com</a>
