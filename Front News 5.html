                        <p>MAPÚA University graduate student Mark Kennedy Bantugon has invented a game changer for global aviation and the local agricultural sector.</p>
                        <p>The “Pili Seal”—a two-component sealant made from the waste material of pili-tree resin, or spent or de-oiled resin—stole the show at the Philippine leg of the James Dyson Awards 2021, where Bantugon was hailed as national winner. If successful, it could create the country’s first aviation-sealant industry, and stimulate a sustainable manufacturing activity in the countryside.</p>
                        <p>Composed of a base and a hardener, the sealant proved strong, reliable, impermeable and heat resistant—ideal for aircraft components that are constantly exposed to liquids and the elements.</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="Front News/pictures/Pili seal.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">Pili Seal</span>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Where it all began</h2>
                        <p>THE process, however, was not easy pickings. It took the young inventor more than 18 months to develop the sealant.</p>
                        <p>Bantugon was accidentally introduced to the potential sealant during a visit to the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) Headquarters. While a custodian was gathering the viscous spent pili resin for disposal, the student asked for samples.</p>
                        <p>After doing some tests, Bantugon realized the spent resin performed better than the jackfruit and antipolo raw materials he used in high school for his earlier invention: a roofing sealant. It didn’t take long before he used the pili de-oiled resin as the foundation in creating the Pili Seal. </p>
                        <p>The fact that it came from a waste material further piqued his excitement. He hoped his win at the James Dyson Awards 2021 conveyed and sparked a paradigm shift on repurposing waste materials.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">“My goal was to introduce and exhibit a new perspective: that a specific waste material can be given a new function or role in our community, which is beneficial not only in the Philippines, but [also] globally,” <b>said Bantugon.</b> “Since the Pili Seal is made of a sustainable raw material, it is safe and healthy to use, compared with toxic and foul-smelling sealants in the market.”</blockquote>
                        <p>His invention is not only inexpensive to produce; it also has the potential to uplift the Philippine farming community, which he and his family are part of, once the demand for the seal and pili-spent resin kicks in.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Overcoming obstacles</h2>
                        <p>BANTUGON’S efforts to produce his aircraft sealant weren’t always smooth sailing. Since he was doing a pioneer study, the lack of scientific research or related literature available meant longer days for him in the lab.</p>
                        <p>Having the experimental sealant checked at industrial-testing facilities also proved to be challenging, as majority refused the samples for fear it might damage their equipment.</p>
                        <p>Fortunately, Bantugon got the support of the DOST’s Advanced Device and Materials Testing Laboratory, or ADMATEL, Forest Products Research and Development Institute, the Energy Research and Testing Laboratory Services of the Department of Energy, and other private testing companies.</p>
                        <p>Nonetheless, Bantugon remained unsatisfied. The young inventor enrolled in Mapúa University’s Master of Science in Materials Science and Engineering by Research program. The university’s reputation of being  a leader in engineering and sciences makes it the ideal environment for those like him who believe in the importance and essence of research.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">“Mapúa trains their student-researchers. They have a lot of students who excel in research and education,” <b>he said.</b> “The quality of education Mapúa provides helps students like me to step out of our comfort zones and pursue our passions.”</blockquote>
                        <p>While waiting for the results of the final and international leg of the James Dyson Award, where his Pili Seal will compete with 84 other inventions worldwide, Bantugon is collaborating with local organizations to help him patent and commercialize his invention.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">“My goal is to use this…as a gateway to create our own manufacturing of aviation sealant [here] in the country,” <b>he added.</b> “I want to give back to the local farming community, particularly in agriculture. I want to give…farmers a new income opportunity.”</blockquote>
                        <p>Bantugon is the second Mapúan whose invention received recognition from the award-giving body. Electrical engineering student Carvey Ehren R. Maigue was named the first-ever Sustainability Winner of the international tilt for the Aurora Renewable Energy and UV Sequestration, or AuREUS, which bested 1,800 other entries from design engineers across 28 countries.</p>
