                          <p class="fs-5 mb-4 fw-lighter">It's been a while since the COVID-19 outbreak where two week suspension of classes turned out to be two years of our life. Graduations, proms, and other events are some of the most important things in our high school life. On the bright side, universities are starting to reopen their doors as authorities approved a 'green light' in implementing face-to-face classes. </p>

                          <p class="fs-5 mb-4 fw-lighter">Students are surprised as the government approved face-to-face classes in the times of rising cases of COVID-19's new variant, Omicron. In result, the government withdraws their decision and decides to push face-to-face later when cases are decreasing.  </p>

                          <p class="fs-5 mb-4 fw-lighter">However, some students have thought of pushing face-to-face classes in these times as they marked the new COVID variant as not a threat to their health. On the other hand, students are more comfortable in learning at online classes as they start to adapt in this setup with their promising grades.</p>

                          <p class="fs-5 mb-4 fw-lighter">A lot of things can factor in when a university decides if they should go forward with face to face classes in select courses as some courses like nursing wouldn’t translate properly if it was taught in an online platform. </p>

                          <p class="fs-5 mb-4 fw-lighter">But given the circumstances the entire world is in, universities, including MAPUA, have a conundrum to deal with that can and will affect its students in the long term as some lessons absolutely must be taught through face to face or said lessons lose their meaning and purpose.</p>

                          <p class="fs-5 mb-4 fw-lighter">Write your thoughts below, fellow Mapuans! We'd love to hear more from your side!</p>
